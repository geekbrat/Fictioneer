<p><strong><a name='newInstall'>New Installation</a></strong></p>
<ol>
  <li> If you intend to write the story texts to the server or allow image uploads 
    CHMOD the folder you intend to store the stories in to 777. If this folder 
    is missing the script will <strong>attempt</strong> to create it for you during 
    the install.</li>
  <li> Move config.php from the docs folder to the main eFiction folder. If the 
    config.php is missing the install script will <strong>attempt</strong> to 
    create it, but it's best if you move it.</li>
  <li>CHMOD config.php to 666. </li>
  <li>Using your web browser, go to the URL for your website(i.e. http://www.yoursite.com) 
    to run the install and set up the admin login. </li>
  <li>Login with the admin login and password set in step #4, and complete the 
    configuration of your site through the Admin panel.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Upgrade from 2.0.X<a name="upgrade20"></a></strong></p>
<p>BACK UP YOUR FILES AND YOUR DATABASE FIRST!! Upload the 3.0 files OVER your 
  2.0 files. DO NOT DELETE YOUR 2.0 FILES UNTIL THE UPGRADE IS COMPLETE! Go to 
  your site. The script will detect that the config.php file is for 2.0 and start 
  the upgrade. </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>You're encouraged to choose one of the skins provided 
  with the 3.0 script until you can update your 2.0 skins.</p>
<p><strong>Upgrade from 1.1<a name="upgrade11"></a></strong></p>
<p>BACK UP YOUR FILES AND YOUR DATABASE FIRST!! Upload the 3.0 files OVER your 
  1.1 files. DO NOT DELETE YOUR 2.0 FILES UNTIL THE UPGRADE IS COMPLETE! Go to 
  your site. The script<br>
  will detect that the config.php file is for 1.1 and start the upgrade. </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>You're encouraged to choose one of the skins provided 
  with the 3.0 script until you can update your 1.1 skins.</p>
<p><strong>Note 2</strong>: Make sure your config.php file is CHMOD'd to 666.</p>
<p><strong>Note 3:</strong> If you have installed blocks that did not come with 
  the 2.0 package, turn them off before starting the upgrade. They will most likely 
  be incompatible!</p>
<p>Initial Configuration<a name="initConfig"></a></p>
<p>After the install script has finished there are still a number of elements 
  of the archive that you must configure before your archive will be operational. 
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#ratings">Ratings</a> - Ratings are a required element for story 
    submission. Ratings are intended to show the intended audience for a story 
    much as the MPAA ratings work for movies. <strong>Note:</strong> You are strongly 
    advised not to use the MPAA ratings for your archive as they have threatened 
    archives with legal action for doing so.</li>
  <li><a href="#categories">Categories</a> (if you chose to have more than one) 
    - How you categorize your archive is at your discretion. Some archives use 
    categories for different fandoms. Others use categories for types of story 
    within a fandom. </li>
  <li><a href="#characters">Characters</a> - Characters is a list of characters 
    used in your stories. Characters can be defined as sitewide or assigned to 
    a specific category.</li>
  <li><a href="#addClass">Classifications</a> - Classifications are other types 
    of &quot;classifications&quot; you want to sort your stories into. In 1.1 
    and 2.0, classifications were hard-coded as genres and warnings. To add new 
    classifications or modify existing classifications required editing a number 
    of core files. With 3.0, you can designate your own classifications. Other 
    classifications that could be used are: spoilers, pairings, story type, language.</li>
  <li><a href="#news">News</a> - It's a good idea to write an initial news story.</li>
  <li><a href="#messageSettings">Message Settings</a> - The install script will 
    load some default messages for your site. You will most likely wish to customize 
    these messages to fit your site. </li>
  <li><a href="#customPages">Custom Pages</a> - Four custom pages are defined 
    in the installation. You will most likely wish to customize these pages to 
    fit your site.</li>
  <li><a href="#profileInfo">Additional User Profile Fields</a> - A number of 
    optional user profile fields were installed though only a few were turned 
    on. You will want to go to Admin-&gt;Profile Information and configure the 
    user profile fields that you want on. If you want a custom profile field, 
    now's the time to add that too.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If you intend to bridge your eFiction site with another 
  script. It's advisable to do it now before you open for business.</p>
<p>Translating eFiction<a name="translate"></a></p>
<p>You can modify most of the text that is displayed in the script by changing 
  the language file in the languages/ folder for the language you selected. Copy 
  the en.php and en_admin.php files and rename them to your chosen language. For 
  instance, en.php would become es.php for Spanish or ru.php for Russian. Just 
  change the text within the quotes for each line to whatever you want it to say. 
  Some wording is included within the skin's files. If you have created a translation 
  for eFiction, we encourage you to share it!</p>
<p>Add New Series<a name="addNewSeries"></a></p>
<p>Series are collections of related stories by the same or multiple authors. 
  A story and its sequels, for example, would be a series. Series might also be 
  used for a &quot;shared universe&quot; in which multiple authors write. The 
  person who creates the series is considered the series &quot;owner&quot; and 
  controls whether or not the series is &quot;open&quot; to contributions by other 
  authors or not. Even if the series is &quot;closed&quot;, the series owner has 
  the option to include stories from other authors in the series. This form is 
  the same as members with an additional option to select the owner of the series. 
</p>
<p>Add New Story<a name="addNewStory"></a></p>
<p>This form is the same as members use in the &quot;Account Info&quot; area except 
  it has an additional option to select the author of the series. You will also 
  see options to validate and mark the story as featured. </p>
<p>Featured Stories<a name="featuredStories"></a></p>
<p>This page allows administrators to manage the featured stories of the site. 
  A story may initially be marked as featured:</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the add/edit story form.</li>
  <li>By clicking on the &quot;Featured&quot; link in the &quot;Admin Options&quot; 
    list for the story.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a story has been marked it will appear in a table on this admin page. 
  From here, site administrators may choose to &quot;retire&quot; the story or 
  remove it's featured status entirely.</p>
<p>News<a name="news"></a></p>
<p>This page is used to add and administer the news stories for the site. </p>
<p>Submissions<a name="submissionQueue"></a></p>
<p>This page allows site adminstrators to manage the stories in the submission 
  queue. This page is only used when automatic validation of stories is turned 
  off and admistrators are manually validating stories. This page will list the 
  stories waiting in the queue. </p>
<p>Skins<a name="skins"></a></p>
<p>This page lets site administrators &quot;hide&quot; skins from members. Administrators 
  are advised to do this while they work on developing a new skin.</p>
<p>Categories<a name="categories"></a></p>
<p>This page is used to manage the site categories. To view a category's sub-categories 
  in the list click on the &quot;+&quot; sign next to the name of the category.</p>
<p>To add categories:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Goto Admin -&gt; Categories.</li>
  <li>For a new top level category click &quot;Add New Top Level Category&quot; 
    or for a new sub-category click on the &quot;Sub-Category&quot; link in the 
    Options column for the parent category.</li>
  <li>Enter the category information and click &quot;Submit&quot;. A locked category 
    is a category where new story submissions are not accepted. It is generally 
    used to &quot;lock&quot; top level categories and force submissions into sub-categories 
    beneath the locked category.</li>
</ol>
<p>Characters<a name="characters"></a></p>
<p>This page is used to manage the characters. Characters for a specific category 
  can be added from the categories page or directly from this page. </p>
<p>To add characters:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose on the category in which to place the characters (or &quot;Sitewide&quot; 
    to make the characters accessible site wide). </li>
  <li>Choose on the number of characters to add.</li>
  <li>Click &quot;Submit&quot;.</li>
  <li>You will now be presented with a form in which to enter the information 
    about each character. A bio for the character is optional. If entered, it 
    will appear at the top of the &quot;Browse&quot; page for that character.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ratings<a name="ratings"></a></p>
<p><strong>Ratings are a required element for story submission.</strong> Ratings 
  are intended to show the intended audience for a story much as the MPAA ratings 
  work for movies. <strong>Note:</strong> You are strongly advised not to use 
  the MPAA ratings for your archive as they have threatened archives with legal 
  action for doing so. The story's rating can also be used to limit access to 
  certain stories. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Rating - The text of the rating. This is limited to 60 characters.</li>
  <li>Warning Pop-up - If this box is checked, a warning pop-up will be displayed 
    for stories with this rating. The text of this warning is defined in the &quot;Warning 
    text&quot; field. If warning pop-up's only once is selected in the settings, 
    the site will remember whether or not this rating warning has appeared and 
    will only display it once. If it is not selected, the warning pop-up will 
    display each time.</li>
  <li>Age Consent Required - If this box is checked, the visitor must have confirmed 
    they are an adult (either via their preferences if they're logged in or via 
    the warning pop-up) before they can view stories with this rating.</li>
  <li>Registered Users Only - If this box is checked, the visitor must be logged 
    in to view stories with this rating.</li>
  <li>Warning text- The warning text that will be displayed to the user in the 
    pop-up warning (if any).</li>
</ul>
<p> Classifications<a name="addClass"></a></p>
<p>Classifications take the place of the genres and warnings from 1.1 and 2.0. 
  The change lets you define your own classifications without hacking into the 
  files. </p>
<p>To add a new classifcation type:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Goto Admin -&gt; Classifications.</li>
  <li>Click on &quot;Add New Classification Type&quot;.</li>
  <li>Enter the name and title for the classification type such as &quot;genres&quot; 
    or &quot;warnings&quot;. The title can be anything you like. The title will 
    be what is displayed on screen. The name will be used in your skin template 
    as a variable so it should be a unique one word description. As an example: 
    enter the name as &quot;genre&quot; and the title as &quot;Genres&quot;.</li>
  <li>Click &quot;Submit&quot;.</li>
  <li>After you click submit you'll be taken back to the table listing your classification 
    types. </li>
  <li>Click on the classification type (&quot;Genres&quot; to continue the example). 
    This will take you to the list of classifications within that type. </li>
  <li>Click &quot;Add New Classifications&quot; to go to the form to add your 
    classifications for that type. You'll have as many blanks on this form as 
    you've set items per page.</li>
  <li>Enter the classifications (to continue the example: romance, action/adventure, 
    mystery) one in each text box.</li>
  <li>Click submit.</li>
</ol>
<p>To edit a classification or classification type click &quot;Edit&quot; in the 
  options in the table. To delete a classification click &quot;delete&quot; in 
  the options.</p>
<p>Members<a name="members"></a></p>
<p>This page gives site administrators a number of options for managing the members 
  of their site. <strong>Note: </strong>Some of these options may be unavailable 
  if you have bridged your eFiction site to another application.</p>
<p>At the top of the page are a number of options to sort members by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All Members - lists all members</li>
  <li>Admins - lists all administrators</li>
  <li>Authors - lists only members who have submitted stories to the archive</li>
  <li>Authors Input by Admins - lists authors who have been added by admins. <strong>Note: 
    </strong>Will not function for bridged sites.</li>
  <li>Non-validated Members - lists members who have not been validated. </li>
  <li>Validated Members - lists members who have been validated</li>
  <li>Locked Members - lists members whose accounts have been locked (banned)</li>
  <li>Unlocked Members - lists members whose accounts are active (non-banned)</li>
</ul>
<p>Validated members are members whose stories by-pass the validation queue and 
  are accepted automatically in archives where administrators are validating stories 
  manually. By clicking on a members name in one of the last four lists, you are 
  choosing to take that action on that member. For instance, if you click on a 
  member's name in the Non-validated Members list, you will be taken to a page 
  that will let you validate that member. The reverse is also true, if you click 
  on a member's name in the Validated Members list, you will be taken to a page 
  that will let you revoke the validated status for that member.</p>
<p>An additional option, at the bottom of the page, for non-bridged sites is the 
  ability to add new members. These are the members that appear in the &quot;Authors 
  Input by Admins&quot; list. When clicking on a name in that list, administrators 
  are given the option to release the author's account to their control.</p>
<p>Mail Users<a name="mailUsers"></a></p>
<p>Site administrators can use this option to mail all members of the site. Administrators 
  may also limit the email to authors or admins in a certain category of the site.</p>
<p>Modules<a name="Modules"></a></p>
<p>This panel will let your control the modules installed on your site. The script 
  comes with one module, challenges. You can find other modules created by others 
  or create your own. Modules are add-on programs that add functionality to your 
  site without you needing to edit the files.</p>
<p>Panels<a name="panels"></a></p>
<p>Panels are new in 3.0. The panels system has been implemented to make eFiction 
  more configurable and easier to customize. Panels are used in a number of places 
  throughout the site. Each panel is  assigned a type. The following types are 
  defined as part of the basic eFiction site:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A - Admin panels</li>
  <li>F - Favorites</li>
  <li>S - Submissions</li>
  <li>B - Browse</li>
  <li>P - Member Profile</li>
  <li>U - Member Account</li>
  <li>L - Top 10 Lists</li>
</ul>
<p>Developers and site administrators also have the option of developing their 
  own types of panels. <a href="#defaultPanels">See the list of default panels.</a></p>
<p>To modify the panel order, select a panel type from the drop-down list at the 
  top of the page then use the arrows to move the panels up and down in the list. 
  To change panel from hidden to visible, click on the edit option to the right 
  of the panel name. </p>
<p>To add a new panel:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click &quot;Add New Panel&quot;.</li>
  <li>Enter the name of the panel. This should be one word alpha-numeric name 
    used to identify the panel.</li>
  <li>Enter the title of the panel. This will be the text displayed on the site 
    for the panel.</li>
  <li>Enter a URL to the panel. If no URL is supplied the script will look for 
    a file with the name of the panel in the default location for that panel type. 
    For instance, for the browse panel named &quot;recent&quot;, the script looks 
    in the browse folder for a file named recent.php. You will need to supply 
    a URL for panels located outside the default location or if you name the file 
    differently than the panel. An example of this would be the browse panel for 
    the challenges module, the URL is &quot;modules/challenges/browse.php&quot;. 
    The file is both outside the default location (the browse/ folder) and also 
    named differently than the panel. The panel is named &quot;challenges&quot;, 
    but the file is named &quot;browse.php&quot;. <strong>Note: </strong>Panels 
    are not interchangable. You cannot use a browse panel for a top ten list panel. 
  </li>
  <li>The panel level is used to determine who has access to that panel. This 
    is most applicable to the admin and member account panels. In the admin panels 
    the level is the admin level required to access the panel. In the member account 
    panels, it is used to determine whether or not the visitor must be logged 
    in to see the panel. 0 is for visitor access (registration, lost password, 
    login) and 1 is for member access (everything else).</li>
  <li>Check the hidden box of you want this panel to be hidden (not displayed 
    in the list of panels).</li>
  <li>Finally, enter the one letter code for the panel type. (See the above list)</li>
  <li>Click &quot;Submit&quot;.</li>
</ol>

</ul>
<p>Site Information<a name="siteInfo"></a></p>
<p>This section of the settings defines general information about your site.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Site Key - You will have defined a site key during installation. <strong>DO 
    NOT EDIT IT! </strong>If you edit the site key, you will need to manually 
    update the site key information in your config.php file to match or your site 
    will stop functioning.</li>
  <li>Site Name - The name of your site. This will be displayed in the title of 
    your site's pages.</li>
  <li>Site Slogan - A slogan for your site. This will also be displayed in the 
    title of your site's pages.</li>
  <li>Site Url - The URL to your eFiction site. <strong>Note:</strong> This <strong>must 
    </strong> be the URL to your eFiction site as the script uses this url in 
    various places including emails sent to your members. It <strong>must not</strong> 
    be the URL to any parent site.</li>
  <li>Table Prefix - The prefix to your database tables. This was also set during 
    installation and should also <strong>NEVER </strong> be changed or your site 
    will cease to function. </li>
  <li>Admin E-mail - The e-mail address used to send and receive e-mails from 
    the site. This must be a valid email address!</li>

  <li>Language - The langauge the site will display in. The eFiction download 
    comes with the English language files. <a href="#translating">See Translating 
    eFiction.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Submission Settings<a name="subSettings"></a></p>
<p>This section of the settings defines various submission settings for the site.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Turn off unsolicited submissions - If &quot;yes&quot; is selected, submissions 
    to the site can only be made by administrators through the &quot;Admin&quot; 
    area. If &quot;no&quot; is selected members will have the option of submitting 
    stories via the &quot;Account Info&quot; link.</li>
  <li>Automatically validate all stories - If &quot;yes&quot; is selected, stories 
    will automatically be displayed on the site. If &quot;no&quot; is selected, 
    stories will be placed into a validation queue for administrators approval 
    and stories will not appear on the site with this approval.</li>
  <li>Co-authors allowed - This is a new feature in 3.0. By choosing &quot;yes&quot;, 
    authors will be allowed to mark other members as co-authors of their stories 
    in the submission process. Note that co-authors have the same rights to edit, 
    add to, and delete the story as the author.</li>
  <li>Allow round robins - Select &quot;yes&quot; if you wish to allow round robins 
    in your archive.</li>

    also elect to save the text of the stories to the database. This is another 
    setting that should not be altered after the inital setup of the site. Click 
    on the checkbox next to the setting to activate it then use the drop down 
    box to change the setting. <strong>Note: </strong> If your web server has 
    safe_mode on, you should use the &quot;mysql&quot; option.</li>
  <li>Stories path - The path to the folder on the server where your story files 
    will be saved. This should be a relative path and should also not be changed 
    after the initial setup of the archive. </li>
  <li>Chapter word count limits - The maximum and minimum allowable word counts 
    for chapters on the site. If you are storing your story text in the database, 
    a maximum word count of 17000 is suggested. </li>
</ul>
<p>Site Settings<a name="siteSettings"></a></p>
<p>This section of the settings defines various general settings used in multiple 
  areas of the site.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use tinyMCE WYSIWYG editor - The tinyMCE editor is a javascript text editor 
    that gives limited &quot;word processor&quot; functionality to the textareas 
    of forms. Members also have the option of turning this setting off (if the 
    site administrator has turned it on) in their preferences.</li>
  <li>Allowed Tags - The HTML tags that will be allowed in uploaded content (stories, 
    reviews, bios) throughout the site. <strong>Note: </strong>If you use the 
    tinyMCE editor, it will alter some tags. The &lt;i&gt; tag becomes &lt;em&gt;. 
    The &lt;b&gt; tag becomes &lt;strong&gt;. These tags need to be included in 
    the list for tinyMCE to work properly.</li>
  <li>Number of categories - Whether or not your site has multiple categories. 
  </li>
  <li>Turn on News Comments - Whether comments are allowed on news stories.</li>
  <li>Turn on Action Log - This option allows administrators to keep log of a 
    variety of actions throughout the site.</li>
  <li>Maintenance - This setting puts the site into maintenance mode. This prevents 
    visitors from entering the site while the administrator works on it. </li>
  <li>Display Debug Information - Turn this setting on will place various pieces 
  of information in HTML comments that will help with fixing problems on the 
  site.</li>
  <li>Use captcha confirmation - Turn this setting on to require a security code 
  confirmation at registration and for anonymous input such as challenges and

<p>Language Censor <a name="langCensor"></a></p>
<p>This section is a list of words that will be forbidden in submissions to the 
  site. They will be disallowed entirely in names and titles. They will be replaced 
  with the first letter and trailing asterisks, a****, in summaries and the text 
  of reviews. Seperate each word with a comma. Placing an asterisk before and/or 
  after the word will act as a wildcard making the censor look for the entire 
  word plus the word used as a suffix and/or prefix. For example, 'frog' will 
  only find 'frog', '*frog' will find 'bullfrog' and 'frog' but not 'froglegs', 
  'frog*' will find both 'frog' and 'froglegs' but not 'bullfrog', '*frog*' will 
  find 'frog', 'bullfrog', and 'froglegs.' To disable the censor simply leave 
  the list of words empty.</p>
<p>Message Settings<a name="messageSettings"></a></p>
<p>The links that follow this header in the settings area are to the default messages 
  for the site. The installation script placed generic text for these messages 
  into the database for you, but you will most likely wish to edit these messages 
  to better reflect your site.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Welcome Message - The welcome message for your site. It is included in your 
    skins using the {welcome} variable.</li>
  <li>Copyright Footer - The footer message for your site. It is included in your 
    skins using the {footer}variable.</li>
  <li>Print Copyright Notice - This notice will be appended to the story text 
    when the &quot;Printer Version&quot; is selected. </li>
  <li>TinyMCE Configuration - If you wish to customize the configuration of the 
    tinyMCE WYSIWYG editor you may enter your configuration information here.</li>

    You will have the option to customize this at the time each letter is sent.</li>

    You will have the option to customize this at the time each letter is sent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Blocks<a name="blocks"></a></p>
<p>Blocks are another part of your eFiction site that let you configure the look 
  and feel of your site. A number of blocks are included with eFiction. You can 
  also create your own or add blocks others have created. The included blocks 
  are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Categories - This block lists the top level categories on your site.</li>
  <li>Featured - This block lists one or more of the featured stories of your 
    site (depending on configuration).</li>
  <li>Info - This block lists a variety of information about your site including 
    the number of: members, authors, stories, words, reviews, and chapters. </li>
  <li>Login - This block displays a login form allowing you to include a login 
    form on the index page or every page should you choose.</li>
  <li>Menu - This block builds a menu from the page links in your site. Configurable.</li>
  <li>News- This block displays one or more of the news items on your site. </li>
  <li>Online - This block displays who is presently online on your site.</li>
  <li>Poll- This block lets you query your members using a multiple choice question. 
    Also includes an archive of poll questions and results.</li>
  <li>Random - This block displays a random story with each page load.</li>
  <li>Recent - This block lists the most recently added/updated stories for your 
    site. </li>
  <li>Search - A simple search box for inclusion in your skins.</li>
  <li>Shoutbox - A shoutbox for your site. Also includes an archive.</li>
  <li>Skinchange - This block displays a drop down that will let visitors who 
    aren't logged in select from the site's skins the one they wish to display.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first page here lists the blocks available to you. Some will have been 
  pre-installed. The first column lists the name of the block and is not editable. 
  The second column, which you can edit, displays the title of the block as it 
  will be displayed on your site. The third column displays the block's status. 
  There are three possible status options.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Inactive - The block is completely off.</li>
  <li>Active - The block will load on <strong>every</strong> page.</li>
  <li>Index Only - The block will load on the index (home) page <strong>only.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It is advisable that if the block does not display on every page, you set it 
  to &quot;Index Only&quot; or &quot;Inactive&quot; as this will save on your 
  site's resources. The one exception to this is the Online block. If you use 
  this block, you <strong>must</strong> set it to &quot;Active&quot; for the block 
  to work properly.</p>
<p>The fourth column, gives you the option to admin the block if there are options 
  to administer.</p>
<p>You may also see the name of a block and the words &quot;Initialize Block&quot; 
  instead of the last three columns. You will see this when a block is available 
  to be installed, but has not been installed yet. The Online, Poll, Search and Shoutbox 
  blocks are not installed by default. Click on &quot;Initialize Block&quot; then 
  change the status of the block to &quot;Active&quot; or &quot;Index Only&quot; 
  to activate it.</p>
<p>Custom Pages<a name="customPages"></a></p>

  contain php code, only HTML and plain text. Four custom pages are defined for 
  you during the installation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>help - A help page for visitors.</li>
  <li>tos - Terms of Service. This page is displayed on the registration page.</li>
  <li>rules - Submission Rules. This page is displayed at the top of the story 
    submission form and is also linked to the default help page.</li>

  you to use in your skins. The script will append &quot;_link&quot; to the name 
  to help prevent naming conflicts with other variables. The title will be the 
  title of the page. For the URL of your custom page, you may use either viewpage.php?id=ID 
  or viewpage.php?page=NAME where ID is the ID number of the page or NAME is the 
  name of the page.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The name for your page should contain letters, numbers, 
  and the underscore character ONLY.</p>
<p>Page Links<a name="pageLinks"></a></p>
<p>This page controls the page links used in the menu block and available for 
  use in the skin as individual links. </p>
<p>Admins<a name="admins"></a></p>
<p>This page is used to give admin privileges to a member of your site. The initial 
  page lists all current admins and also gives you the option to add a new admin.</p>

  This page is given as a courtesy. <strong>If you are upgrading from 1.1, </strong><strong>delete 
  the phpinfo.php in the main folder</strong>. The phpinfo.php file included with 
  1.1 was not secured and will allow hackers access to the same information it 
  gives you. This admin page is only available to site administrators.</p>

  items on/off. Click edit. Check the box next to &quot;Field enabled&quot; to 
  turn the field on. On the same form you can change the name and title of the

  in the registration/edit bio form and the profile.</p>

    bio form will present a text box for the member to enter their id.</li>

    and display of the item. The aol, icq, msn, and yahoo fields use custom code.</li>
