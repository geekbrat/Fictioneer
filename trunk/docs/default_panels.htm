<p>Admin Panels:<br>
  <br>
  The admin panels control the different admin options for the site.&nbsp; In 
  2.0 the list was static.&nbsp; Putting the admin options into panels allows 
  site owners the option of changing the access level for the various features. 
  It also allows new options to be added without editing everything.&nbsp; The 
  0-4 levels in the panel are most applicable here.&nbsp; The levels 1 to 4 indicate 
  the admin level required to access a certain feature.<br>

  Submissions Panels:<br>
  <br>
  The submission panels will only be displayed in the user panel if submissions 
  are turned on. They were placed in a type separate from the user panels so they 
  would be turned on and off<br>
  together based on the submission site settings.<br>

  As an extra level of security here.&nbsp; The &quot;level&quot; of the panel 
  should be set to either 0 or 1.&nbsp; Panels with level 0 will be displayed 
  to anyone.&nbsp; Panels with level 1 will be displayed only to logged in<br>
  members.&nbsp; The login, register, and lost password panels are currently the 
  only panels set to level 0 for the user account area.<br>
