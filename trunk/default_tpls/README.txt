This is a very generic skin for your site.  Please DO NOT edit these files. (At least not until you're VERY sure you know what you're doing when 
creating skins)  If your default skin goes missing or pieces of any of your skin are left out, the script will automatically use the files in this folder to
fill in the blanks.  This also allows you to cheat when creating skins.  You can basically "inherit" these .tpls in any of your skins simply by omitting 
that .tpl from that skin's folder.  The only exceptions are header.tpl, footer.tpl, and style.css.  Those three files are REQUIRED for all skins.

PLEASE, if you want to make changes to this skin, copy the files into a folder inside the skins folder and make your changes there first.
